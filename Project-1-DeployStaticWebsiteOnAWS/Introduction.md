## Deploy Static Website on AWS

# 1- Introduction

In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS.

## Project Overview
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:

* Hosting a static website on S3 and
* Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. Recall that CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.

*Note that Static website hosting essentially requires a public bucket, whereas the CloudFront can work with public and private buckets.*

In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

* You will create a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
* You will configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
* You will speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
* You will access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
