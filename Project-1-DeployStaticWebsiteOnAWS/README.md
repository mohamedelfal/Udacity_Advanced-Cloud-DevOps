# Project 1: Deploy Static Website on AWS

# 1- Introduction [🔝](#project-1)

In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS.

## Project Overview [🔝](#project-1)
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:

* Hosting a static website on S3 and
* Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. Recall that CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.

*Note that Static website hosting essentially requires a public bucket, whereas the CloudFront can work with public and private buckets.*

In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

* You will create a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
* You will configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
* You will speed up content delivery using AWS’s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
* You will access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.

# 2- Create S3 Bucket [🔝](#project-1)
1- Navigate to the “AWS Management Console” page, type “S3” in the “Find Services” box and then select “S3”.

  ![Navigate to the S3 service](./image/1.png)Navigate to the S3 service
  
2- The Amazon S3 dashboard displays. Click “Create bucket”.

 
  ![Create a bucket](./image/2.png) Create a bucket

3- In the **General configuration**, enter a “Bucket name” and a region of your choice. Note: Bucket names must be globally unique.

  ![General configuration](./image/3.png) One of the convenient naming conventions is `my-123456789-bucket`, where you can replace `123456789` with your 12 digit AWS account ID.


4- In the **Bucket settings for Block Public Access** section, uncheck the “Block all public access”. It will enable the public access to the bucket objects via the S3 object URL.

**Note** - We are allowing the public access to the bucket contents because we are going to host a static website in this bucket. 
**Hosting requires the content should be publicly readable.**


 ![Allow the public access to the bucket contents](./image/4.png)Allow the public access to the bucket contents

5- Click “Next” and click “Create bucket”.

6- Once the bucket is created, click on the name of the bucket to open the bucket to the contents.
 ![Bucket](./image/5.png)
Bucket `my-014421265158-bucket` configuration and content

# 3- Upload files to S3 Bucket [🔝](#project-1)
1- Once the bucket is open to its contents, click the “Upload” button.

 ![Click on the Upload button](./image/6.png)*Click on the **Upload** button*

2- Click the "Add files" and “Add folder” button, and upload the Student-ready starter code folder content from your local computer to the S3 bucket.

 ![*Click "Add files" to upload the `index.html` file, and click "Add folder" to upload the `css`, `img`, and `vendor` folders.*

*Click "Add files" to upload the `index.html` file, and click "Add folder" to upload the `css`, `img`, and `vendor` folders.*

 ![Do not select the `udacity-starter-website` folder. Instead, upload its content one-by-one.](./image/8.png)

# 4- Secure Bucket via IAM [🔝](#project-1)
1- Click on the “Permissions” tab.
 
 ![Go to the Permissions tab. See that the bucket allows public access for hosting.](./image/10.png)*Go to the **Permissions** tab. See that the bucket allows public access for hosting.*

2- The “Bucket Policy” section shows it is empty. Click on the Edit button.
![Empty bucket policy. Check this policy again after setting up the CloudFront distribution.](./image/11.png)*Empty bucket policy. Check this policy again after setting up the CloudFront distribution.*


3- Enter the following bucket policy replacing `your-website` with the name of your bucket and click “Save”.

```
{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
"Statement":[
 {
   "Sid":"AddPerm",
   "Effect":"Allow",
   "Principal": "*",
   "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
   "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::your-website/*"]
 }
]
}
```
You will see warnings about making your bucket public, but **this step is required for static website hosting.**


**Note** - If we were not learning about static website hosting, we could have made the bucket private and wouldn't have to specify any bucket access policy explicitly. 
In such a case, once we set up the ***CloudFront distribution***, it will automatically update the current bucket access policy to access the bucket content. 

The CloudFront service will make this happen by using the **Origin Access Identity** user.

# 5- Configure S3 Bucket [🔝](#project-1)
1- Go to the **Properties** tab and then scroll down to edit the **Static website hosting** section.
![Go to the Properties tab
](12.png)
*Go to the **Properties** tab*

![Edit the Static website hosting section](./image/13.png)
*Edit the **Static website hosting** section*

2- Click on the “Edit” button to see the **Edit static website hosting** screen. Now, enable the **Static website hosting**, and provide the default home page and error page for your website.
![Enable the static website hosting, and provide the home page and error page.](./image/14.png)
*Enable the static website hosting, and provide the home page and error page.*

>> *Did you notice that enabling the static website hosting requires you to make your bucket public?*
>> 
>> *In the snapshot above, it says "For your customers to access the content at the website endpoint, you must make all your content **publicly readable**."*

3- For both “Index document” and “Error document”, enter “index.html” and click “Save”. 
After successfully saving the settings, check the **Static website hosting sectio**n again under the **Properties** tab. 
You must now be able to view the [website endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteEndpoints.html) as shown below:
![Copy the website endpoint for future use.](./image/15.png)
*Copy the website endpoint for future use.*


# 6- Distribute Website via CloudFront [🔝](#project-1)
1- Select “Services” from the top left corner and enter “cloud front” in the “Find a service by name or feature” text box and select “CloudFront”.
![1- Select “Services” from the top left corner and enter “cloud front” in the “Find a service by name or feature” text box and select “CloudFront”.](./image/16.png)

2- From the CloudFront dashboard, click “Create Distribution”.
![2- From the CloudFront dashboard, click “Create Distribution”.](./image/17.png)

3- For “Select a delivery method for your content”, click “Get Started”.
![3- For “Select a delivery method for your content”, click “Get Started”.](./image/18.png)


4- Use the following details to create a distribution:
|Field	|Value|
|:------ |:------|
|Origin > Domain Name	|Don't select the bucket from the dropdown list. Paste the Static website hosting endpoint of the form  <bucket-name>.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`|
|Origin > Enable Origin Shield|	No|
|Default cache behavior|	Use default settings|	
|Cache key and origin requests|	Use default settings|

  ![Configurations - Origin details](./image/19.png)
*Configurations - Origin details*

![Configurations - Cache behavior, key and origin requests](./image/20.png)
*Configurations - Cache behavior, key and origin requests*
Configurations - Cache behavior, key and origin requests

5- Leave the defaults for the rest of the options, and click “Create Distribution”. 
  It may take up to 10 minutes for the CloudFront Distribution to get created.
  
**Note**: It may take up to **10 minutes** for the CloudFront Distribution to be created.

6- Once the status of your distribution changes from “In Progress” to “Deployed”, copy the endpoint URL for your CloudFront distribution found in the “Domain Name” column.
>> **Note** - Remember, as soon as your CloudFront distribution is **Deployed**, it attaches to S3 and starts caching the S3 pages. 
>> CloudFront may take 10-30 minutes (or more) to cache the S3 page. Once the caching is complete, the CloudFront domain name URL will stop redirecting to the S3 object URL.

![In this example, the Domain Name value is `dgf7z6g067r6d.cloudfront.net`, but ***yours will be different***.](./image/21.png)
